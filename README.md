# Project: Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŒˆ
The Etch-a-Sketch project was developed as part of my learning journey with the help and guidance of TheOdinProject. TheOdinProject is a comprehensive curriculum that offers practical hands-on projects to help individuals learn web development.

The goal of this project was to recreate the nostalgic experience of drawing on an Etch-a-Sketch using modern web technologies. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to create a digital version of the toy that runs directly in a web browser.

## Learnings & Challenges
During the development process, I encountered several challenges and struggled with various aspects of the project. These struggles provided valuable learning opportunities and helped me enhance my skills as a web developer. Some of the major challenges I faced include:

- **Responsiveness:** As the developer of this Etch-a-Sketch project, I want to acknowledge that I encountered challenges in making it fully responsive across different devices and screen sizes. I understand that the current version may not look optimal on all devices.

- **Code Organization:** Structuring the project and organizing the code in a modular and maintainable manner was a struggle. I didn't manage to apply best practices and clean code in Javascript, but once I go forward, I will make sure that I fix this and try to apply best practices to become a good developer.

- **Layout and Design:** As a beginner in HTML and CSS, one of the main struggles I faced was creating an appealing layout for the Etch-a-Sketch project. I had difficulty positioning the various elements on the page and achieving the desired visual aesthetics, but thankfully I managed to make the same layout on my design in figma.

Working on this Etch-a-Sketch project has been a valuable learning experience for me. I gained practical knowledge in:

- **DOM manipulation:** Modifying and updating the HTML structure dynamically using JavaScript.

- **Event handling:** Attaching event listeners to elements and responding to user actions.

- **Function implementation and organization:** Breaking down tasks into reusable functions for improved code structure.

- **Problem-solving and debugging:** Enhancing troubleshooting skills to identify and resolve issues efficiently.
